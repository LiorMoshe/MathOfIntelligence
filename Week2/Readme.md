Solution for the coding challenge of the [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIFMLK2nj_w).
In this challenge we implemented newton's method for root finding (also known as newton-raphson) and newton's method for second order optimization.
We compared between the second order optimization using newton's method and the first order optimization using Gradient Descent on a given dataset for a linear regression task.
